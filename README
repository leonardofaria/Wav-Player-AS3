# Why I developed this?

	Flash Player don't support .wav sound format. Really ? Yes it is.
	
	Check this url : http://helpx.adobe.com/flash/kb/supported-codecs-flash-player.html
	
	IE 6,7,8 don't support HTML5. No way...  You are here !! 
	
# Other Solutions and Why I shared all codes?

	I lost my two day for looking a player which is working at all platforms. 
	
	Don't lose your time.
	
# My Solution ?

    I suggest you to use HTML5 player when your visitor browser support it.
	 
	But in the real world , there is still someone continue to use IE 6,7,8. 
	 
	Let's be realistic HTML5 is awesome but, if you need this player. You have to support everyone as like me.
	
# Thanks 

	I used this library : https://code.google.com/p/as3wavsound/

	Feel free to use my player. 
	
	If you need to use Network Access. You'll see two different player for that. 
	
	It's because of Adobe Flash Security Policies. Also , upload the crossdomain.xml to your server.
